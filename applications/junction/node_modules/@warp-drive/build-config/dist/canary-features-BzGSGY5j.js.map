Canary builds are published\n * to `npm` and can be installed using a precise tag (such as `ember-data@3.16.0-alpha.1`)\n * or by installing the latest dist-tag published to the `canary` channel using your javascript\n * package manager of choice. For instance with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)\n\n  ```cli\n  pnpm add ember-data@canary\n  ```\n *\n * ### Activating a Canary Feature\n *\n * Once you have installed canary, feature-flags can be activated at build-time\n *\n * by setting an environment variable:\n *\n * ```cli\n * # Activate a single flag\n * EMBER_DATA_FEATURE_OVERRIDE=SOME_FLAG ember build\n *\n * # Activate multiple flags by separating with commas\n * EMBER_DATA_FEATURE_OVERRIDE=SOME_FLAG,OTHER_FLAG ember build\n *\n * # Activate all flags\n * EMBER_DATA_FEATURE_OVERRIDE=ENABLE_ALL_OPTIONAL ember build\n * ```\n *\n * or by setting the appropriate flag in your `ember-cli-build` file:\n *\n * ```ts\n * let app = new EmberApp(defaults, {\n *   emberData: {\n *     features: {\n *       SAMPLE_FEATURE_FLAG: false // utliize existing behavior, strip code for the new feature\n *       OTHER_FEATURE_FLAG: true // utilize this new feature, strip code for the older behavior\n *     }\n *   }\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * **The \"off\" branch of feature-flagged code is always stripped from production builds.**\n *\n * The list of available feature-flags is located [here](https://github.com/emberjs/data/tree/main/packages/build-config/src/virtual/canary-features.ts \"List of EmberData FeatureFlags\")\n *\n *\n * ### Preparing a Project to use a Canary Feature\n *\n * For most projects, simple version detection should be enough.\n * Using the provided version compatibility helpers from [embroider-macros](https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/tree/main/packages/macros#readme)\n * the following can be done:\n *\n * ```js\n * if (macroCondition(dependencySatisfies('@ember-data/store', '5.0'))) {\n *   // do thing\n * }\n * ```\n *\n   @module @warp-drive/build-config/canary-features\n   @main @warp-drive/build-config/canary-features\n */\n/**\n  This is the current list of features used at build time for canary releases.\n  If empty there are no features currently gated by feature flags.\n\n  The valid values are:\n\n  - `true` | The feature is **enabled** at all times, and cannot be disabled.\n  - `false` | The feature is **disabled** at all times, and cannot be enabled.\n  - `null` | The feature is **disabled by default**, but can be enabled via configuration.\n\n  @class CanaryFeatureFlags\n  @public\n*/\nexport const SAMPLE_FEATURE_FLAG: boolean | null = null;\n"],"names":["SAMPLE_FEATURE_FLAG"],"mappings":"AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;;AAEA;;AAEA;AACA;AACA;;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AACO,MAAMA,mBAAmC,GAAG;;;;;;;;;"}
