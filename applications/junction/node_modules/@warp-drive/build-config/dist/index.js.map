For instance, an App could be using `3.16` while specifying compatibility\n * with `3.12`. This would remove any deprecations that were present in or before `3.12`\n * but keep support for anything deprecated in or above `3.13`.\n *\n * You may also specify that specific deprecations are resolved. These approaches\n * may be used together.\n *\n * ```ts\n * setConfig(app, __dirname, {\n *   // declare that all deprecations through \"5.0\" have been fully resolved\n *   compatWith: '5.0',\n *\n *   // mark individual deprecations as resolved by setting them to `false`\n *   deprecations: {\n *     // resolve individual deprecations here\n *   },\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * > [!TIP]\n * > EmberData does not test against permutations of deprecations\n * > being stripped, our tests run against \"all deprecated code included\"\n * > and \"all deprecated code removed\".

Under the new behavior, the local state would remain B.\n *\n * If the remote state was A while its local state was `null`, then under the old\n * behavior if the remote state changed to C, the local state would be updated to C.\n * Under the new behavior, the local state would remain `null`.\n *\n * Thus the new correct mental model is that the state of the relationship at any point\n * in time is whatever the most recent remote state is, plus any local additions or removals\n * you have made that have not yet been reflected by the remote state.\n *\n * > Note: The old behavior extended to modifying the inverse of a relationship.

For relationships with inverses, both sides MUST be migrated to the new\n * behavior at the same time.\n *\n * ```js\n * class Person extends Model {\n *  @hasMany('person', {\n *    async: false,\n *    inverse: null,\n *    resetOnRemoteUpdate: false\n *  }) children;\n *\n *  @belongsTo('person', {\n *    async: false,\n *    inverse: null,\n *    resetOnRemoteUpdate: false\n *  }) parent;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * > Note: false is the only valid value here, all other values (including missing)\n * > will be treated as true, where `true` is the legacy behavior that is now deprecated.\n *\n * Once you have migrated all relationships, you can remove the the resetOnRemoteUpdate\n * option and set the deprecation flag to false in ember-cli-build.\n *\n * ### What if I don't want the new behavior?\n *\n * EmberData's philosophy is to not make assumptions about your application. Where possible\n * we seek out \"100%\" solutions – solutions that work for all use cases - and where that is\n * not possible we default to \"90%\" solutions – solutions that work for the vast majority of use\n * cases. In the case of \"90%\" solutions we look for primitives that allow you to resolve the\n * 10% case in your application. If no such primitives exist, we provide an escape hatch that\n * ensures you can build the behavior you need without adopting the cost of the default solution.\n *\n * In this case, the old behavior was a \"40%\" solution. The inability for an application developer\n * to determine what changes were made locally, and thus what changes should be preserved, made\n * it impossible to build certain features easily, or in some cases at all. The proliferation of\n * feature requests, bug reports (from folks surprised by the prior behavior) and addon attempts\n * in this space are all evidence of this.\n *\n * We believe the new behavior is a \"90%\" solution. It works for the vast majority of use cases,\n * often without noticeable changes to existing application behavior, and provides primitives that\n * allow you to build the behavior you need for the remaining 10%.\n *\n * The great news is that this behavior defaults to trusting your API similar to the old behavior.\n * If your API is correct, you will not need to make any changes to your application to adopt\n * the new behavior.\n *\n * This means the 10% cases are those where you can't trust your API to provide the correct\n * information. In these cases, because you now have cheap access to a diff of the relationship\n * state, there are a few options that weren't available before:\n *\n * - you can adjust returned API payloads to contain the expected changes that it doesn't include\n * - you can modify local state by adding or removing records on the HasMany record array to remove\n *   any local changes that were not returned by the API.\n * - you can use `<Cache>.mutate(mutation)` to directly modify the local cache state of the relationship\n *   to match the expected state.\n *\n * What this version (5.3) does not yet provide is a way to directly modify the cache's remote state\n * for the relationship via public APIs other than via the broader action of upserting a response via\n * `<Cache>.put(document)`. However, such an API was sketched in the Cache 2.1 RFC\n * `<Cache>.patch(operation)` and is likely to be added in a future 5.x release of EmberData.\n *\n * This version (5.3) also does not yet provide a way to directly modify the graph (a general purpose\n * subset of cache behaviors specific to relationships) via public APIs. However, during the\n * 5.x release series we will be working on finalizing the Graph API and making it public.\n *\n * If none of these options work for you, you can always opt-out more broadly by implementing\n * a custom Cache with the relationship behaviors you need.\n *\n * @property DEPRECATE_RELATIONSHIP_REMOTE_UPDATE_CLEARING_LOCAL_STATE\n * @since 5.3\n * @until 6.0\n * @public\n */\nexport const DEPRECATE_RELATIONSHIP_REMOTE_UPDATE_CLEARING_LOCAL_STATE = '5.3';\n\n/**\n * **id: ember-data:deprecate-many-array-duplicates**\n *\n * When the flag is `true` (default), adding duplicate records to a `ManyArray`\n * is deprecated in non-production environments.
